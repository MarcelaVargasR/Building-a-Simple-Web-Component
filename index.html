      <h3 style="text-align: center">Everest Mountain</h3>
      <p>
        Its 8,840 meters high are the roof of the world. This mythical peak is
        located in the Himalayas, on the border between China and Nepal. The
        first to reach its summit were Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, on May
        23, 1953. Although it is known by the name of the famous Welsh
        geographer George Everest, in Tibetan it is Chomolungma (or Qomolangma);
        that is, the "Mother of the universe."

      <p>
        At 8,611 meters, it is the second highest in the world. Also known as
        Chogori, it is located between China and Pakistan. The first ascent of
        this mythical Himalayan peak was that of Achille Compagnoni and Lino
        Lacedelli on July 31, 1954. The technical difficulty of its ascent makes
        it one of the most dangerous in the world. In fact, almost 25% of those
        who attempted their ascent perished; hence it is known as "the wild
        mountain".

      <p>
        The name of the third highest peak in the world means "the five
        treasures of the snow" (gold, silver, gems, grain and sacred books) and
        is 8,586 meters high. In the local Limbu language, it means "mountain to
        which we make offerings." So it is clear that it is a sacred mountain.
        It is located between India and Nepal and its first ascent dates back to
        May 25, 1955. Since then, 40 people have lost their lives on the climb.
